# 100DaysofCode
Log of my journey for the 100DaysofCode Challenge.


Day 1 - Jan 15, 2017

Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Got a basic framework, will still need lots of work. Also added some lorem ipsum for structural content.


Day 2 - Jan 16, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Added tags, more future tag placement, added placeholder tags.
Had to research some HTML and CSS tags for help with id'ing tags.
