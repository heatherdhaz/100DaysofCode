# 100DaysofCode
Log of my journey for the 100DaysofCode Challenge.


Day 1 - Jan 15, 2017

Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Got a basic framework, will still need lots of work. Also added some lorem ipsum for structural content.


Day 2 - Jan 16, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Added tags, more future tag placement, added placeholder tags.
Had to research some HTML and CSS tags for help with id'ing tags.


Day 3 - Jan 17, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Fixed the image, changed margins, fixed the header and nav bar area. More tweaking of code done.

Day 4 - Jan 18, 2017
Project: Class Project - Redesign the Holstee Manifesto in HTML & CSS
This was more than 1 hour, but so good as it stretched my memory and researching skills. I'm happy with how it turned out, may go back to it in the future to see if I can "fix' a few things.
