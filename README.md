# 100DaysofCode
Log of my journey for the 100DaysofCode Challenge.


Day 1 - Jan 15, 2017

Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Got a basic framework, will still need lots of work. Also added some lorem ipsum for structural content.


Day 2 - Jan 16, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Added tags, more future tag placement, added placeholder tags.
Had to research some HTML and CSS tags for help with id'ing tags.


Day 3 - Jan 17, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Fixed the image, changed margins, fixed the header and nav bar area. More tweaking of code done.

Day 4 - Jan 18, 2017
Project: Class Project - Redesign the Holstee Manifesto in HTML & CSS
This was more than 1 hour, but so good as it stretched my memory and researching skills. I'm happy with how it turned out, may go back to it in the future to see if I can "fix' a few things.

Day 5 - Jan 19, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
I did some fixing of links and tags, moved files to folders.
Not too much done again, but I continue to learn from mistakes, while making new ones.

Day 6 - Jan 20, 2017
Project: 1st - Portfolio website
Added different link attributes for static and hover states, messed around with the footer, added links to sections of the document from the navbar.
It was great remembering how to change the links.

Day 7 - Jan 21, 2017
Project: Class Project - Portfolio HTML
Build up the content and tags for an HTML file from the ground up. Will be working on the CSS tomorrow.

Day 8 - Jan 23, 2017
Project: Class Project - Portfolio
Added a couple of section tags, renamed some divs,. - Also made a mistake when committing with the wrong day, should be Day 8 not Day 6.

Day 9 - Jan 24, 2017
Project: Portfolio Project
Added new colours, fixed more HTML and CSS id's, added some comments to the code for better organizing.

Day 10 - Jan 26, 2017
Project: Class Project - Rogue
Rebuild a website from an image. The project was a PSD to HTML, but I don't have PSD so unable to get exacts only estimates. I think I did pretty good, I guess I'll see. I was a great exercise.


Day 11 - Jan 27, 2017
Project: Portfolio Project
Added tags and border, still trying to figure out what else to do for it, until I get further.

Day 12 - Jan 29, 2017
Project: Profolio/Resume Project
I will call this Cupcake Resume Project, because its for a cupcake. I believe I have one more day for ver 1.
Today I fixed up the borders, added padding, removed tags that were redundant, it looks a whole lot better now. A lot cleaner, but that footer is getting the best of me. That will be tomorrows work.

Day 13 - Jan 30, 2017
Project: Portfolio/Resume Project
Project Cupcake Resume ver1 is getting more polished. Still a few more things to finish off.
I'll be glad when I complete this part of it. Not perfect but, it is something.
